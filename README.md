# Extinguish

Here is the release page of Extinguish.

Extinguish turn your screen off but keep your device wake ( not going to the lock screen ), which let other apps run on screen off. 

Extinguish can achieve the following behaviors: turn off the screen and hang up, temporarily turn off the screen when listening to others while getting note, listen to videos with your screen off, etc. In daily usage, the screen consumes about 10% to 20% of your device's power consumption. And on OLED screen, the screen is lit for a long time or displaying one screen for a long time may lead to screen burn. But with Extinguish you can avoid all of these.
